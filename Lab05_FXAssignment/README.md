## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

- JDK runtime: JavaSE-23
- JavaFX: 23.0.2

## Run the code

I already write the launch.json file in .vscode folder, so you can use 'Run and Debug' function in the left panel and then click 'Launch App' to run the code.(If you open this project in VS Code IDE)

Please make sure your JDK runtime and JavaFX version is the same as the one specified above or it may fail to run.
